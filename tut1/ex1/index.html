     <h1>The History of HTML</h1>
     <p>A markup language combines <b>text as well as coded instructions on how to format that text.</b></p>
     <p>Nowadays, if you mention the term <b>markup</b> to any knowledgeable web author, the first thing they are likely to think of is <b>HTML</b></p>
     <p>So from whence came the stuff that web pages are made of? ... </p>
     <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
     <p>HTML — which is short for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> — is the official language of the <b>World Wide Web</b> and was first conceived in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee:</p>
        <p>HTML is a product of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) which is a complex, technical specification describing markup languages, especially those used in electronic document exchange, document management, and document publishing.</p>
    <p>HTML was <i>originally created to allow those who were not specialized in SGML</i> to publish and exchange scientific and other technical documents.</p>
    <p>HTML especially facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link documents electronically using hyperlinks. Thus the name Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
